# Sandbox - Violin Physical Model and Interface

Note - this is boilerplate code, full of drafts

Except for synthController.pd, all code in the /sound_engine folder was generated via the Faust script in the same folder (violin_FaustRomainChion.dsp)

**Goals**
- Sandbox for testing:
-- Various input types (LeapMotion, Kinect, RGB camera, marker-based mocap, Myo, ...)
-- Various movement/pose features 
- Defy implementations that use gesture recognition

## Contents
- The violin physical model is a Faust extension of STK's implementation
